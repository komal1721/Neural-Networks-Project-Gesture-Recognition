## Gesture Recognition - Neural Network
### Problem Statement: 
We need to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognize five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. The following table consists of the experiments done to build a model to predict the gestures from the given data set.
